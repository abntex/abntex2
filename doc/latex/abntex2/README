or https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages (english) for more
information on installing packages.

"Automagic" instalation on a TeXLive system
-------------------------------------------

If you already have a TexLive system installed on a Unix-like system (Linux, Mac, BSD),
in order to install the abntex2 class and the abntex2cite package, uncompress the TDS file (something like 
abntex2-tds-VERSION.zip or abntex2-tds-VERSION.tar.gz) and type on a Terminal:

  make install

This will install abnTeX2 on your TeXLive system. 

Manual instalation
------------------

You can manually install the abntex2 class and the abntex2cite package in any LaTeX system (TeXLive, MiKTeX, 
among others) running over a Windows, Linux, Mac, BSD (among others) if you have:
