INSTALLATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you new on TeX's world?
---------------------------

If you're new to this, see https://github.com/abntex/abntex2/wiki/Instalacao (portuguese)
or https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Installing_Extra_Packages (english) for more
information on installing packages.

"Automagic" instalation on a TeXLive system
-------------------------------------------

If you already have a TexLive system installed on a Unix-like system (Linux, Mac, BSD),
in order to install the abntex2 class and the abntex2cite package, uncompress the TDS file (something like
abntex2-tds-VERSION.zip or abntex2-tds-VERSION.tar.gz) and type on a Terminal:

  make install

This will install abnTeX2 on your TeXLive system.

Manual instalation
------------------

You can manually install the abntex2 class and the abntex2cite package in any LaTeX system (TeXLive, MiKTeX,
among others) running over a Windows, Linux, Mac, BSD (among others) if you have:

  abntex2.cls	            The abntex2 class file.
  abntex2cite.sty	        The abntex2cite citation package file.
  abntex2abrev.sty	        Extension of abntex2cite package. It contains abbreviations helpers macros.

  abntex2-num.bst			Alphanumeric (author-date) citation style file.
  abntex2-options.bib	    Default citation options configurations.

Put those files somewhere LaTeX can find them. Read the documentation of
your LaTeX system to find out where this might be.

Test the installation
